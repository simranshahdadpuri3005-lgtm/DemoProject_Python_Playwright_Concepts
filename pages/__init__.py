# if we are using python version 3.3  or below we should have a file named  __init__.py
# else it is optional
# this file is used to mark a directory as a package
# this file can be empty or we can put some code in it
# this file can also be used to define what is exported when the package is imported
# in this file we can also put some package level variables or functions
# for example we can define a variable named __all__ to specify the modules to be exported
